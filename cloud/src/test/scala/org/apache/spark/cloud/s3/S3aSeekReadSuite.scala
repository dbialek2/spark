    """Assess cost of seek and read operations.
      | When moving the cursor in an input stream, an HTTP connection may be closed and
      | then re-opened. This can be very expensive; tactics like streaming forwards instead
      | of seeking, and/or postponing movement until the following read ('lazy seek') try
      | to address this. Logging these operation times helps track performance.
      | This test also tries to catch out a regression, where a `close()` operation
      | is implemented through reading through the entire input stream. This is exhibited
      | in the time to `close()` while at offset 0 being `O(len(file))`.
      |
      | Note also the cost of `readFully()`; this method call is common inside libraries
