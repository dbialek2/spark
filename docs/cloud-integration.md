## Introduction

Apache Spark

## Important: Cloud object stores are not like filesystems


Object stores are not filesystems: they are not a hierarchical tree of directories and files.

The Hadoop filesystem APIs offer a filesystem API to the object stores, but underneath
they are still object stores, [and the difference is significant](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/introduction.html)

In particular, the following behaviours are not normally those of a filesysem

### Directory operations may not be atomic

Directory rename and delete may be performed as a series of operations on the client. Specifically,
`delete(path, recursive=true)` may be implemented as "list the objects, delete them singly or in batches".
`rename(source, dest)` may be implemented as "copy all the objects" followed by the delete operation.


1. They may fail part way through, leaving the status of the filesystem "undefined".
1. The time to delete may be `O(files)`
1. The time to rename may be `O(data)`. If the rename is done on the client, the time to rename
each file will depend upon the bandwidth between client and the filesystem. The further away the client
is, the longer the rename will take.

Because of these behaviours, committing of work by renaming directories is neither efficient nor
reliable. There is a special output committer for Parquet, the `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.DirectParquetOutputCommitter`
which bypasses the rename phase.

*Critical* speculative execution does not work against object
stores which do not support atomic directory renames. Your output may get
corrupted

### Data is not written until the output stream's `close()` operation.

Data to be written to the object store is usually buffered to a local file or stored in memory,
until one of: there is enough data to crete a partition in a multi-partitioned upload, or
when the output stream's `close()` operation is done.

- If the process writing the data fails, nothing may have been written.
- Data may be visible in the object store until the entire output stream is complete
- There may not be an entry in the object store for the file (even a 0 byte one) until
that stage.

### The object stores eventual consistency may be visible, especially when updating or deleting data.

Object stores are often *Eventually Consistent*. This can surface, in particular:-

- When listing "a directory"; newly created files may not yet be visible, deleted ones still present.
- After updating an object: opening and reading the object may still return the previous data.
- After deleting an obect: opening it may succeed, returning the data

For many years, Amazon US East S3 lacked create consistency: attempting to open a newly created object
could return a 404 response, which Hadoop maps to a `FileNotFoundException`. This was fixed in August 2015
â€”see [S3 Consistency Model](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel)
for the full details.
